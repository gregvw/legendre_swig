legendre_swig will consist of a number of Legendre spectral methods 
to ultimately be implemented on a GPU

Currently it consists of the internal method legendreEvalPt which 
evaluates a Legendre series at one point and the wrapped method
legendreEval which evaluates a Legendre series on a sequence of points.
